Description
==================================================================

The S3ProxyChunkUpload is application that allows you to upload files of any size to the Amazon S3 service.

What is the problem:
If you have a mobile application that allows your customers to keep files on the Amazon S3 service,
 but your customers have a bad or unstable network connection, you will face the problem when you need repeatedly try to upload a file.

Amazon S3 is supporting chuncked upload, but each part should has a size of 5 megabytes (MB) or more.
 In most cases, the files sent via the mobile application are smaller, so for small files a different approach is needed.

To solve this problem, we have developed the S3ProxyChunkUpload that is a proxy server between your application and the Amazon S3.
The S3ProxyChunkUpload app allows you to upload a file consisting of any number and any size of parts,
even if the user of your application has a low internet speed or there will be a loss of connection,
it will be able to upload part of the file and uploading other parts of file when the connection will be restored.

This application allows you to upload files in any size and any number of parts,
if there is a loss of connection, you will need to upload only a part of the file instead repeat uploading whole file.

After each upload of a part of the file, a response is sent with the result of the operation,
so you can always monitor from your application the number of already uploaded parts of the files.
After all the parts of the file are uploaded, all parts of the file will be combined to create the source file and sends the file to the Amazon S3.


Also there are some additional features that will allow:
- convert video  the uploaded to Amazon file (using the elastic transcoder service of Amazon).
- convert the file to another format for example  mp3 to wav (using the elastic transcoder service of Amazon).
- use mysql or postgres database
